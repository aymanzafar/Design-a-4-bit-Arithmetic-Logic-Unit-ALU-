# VLSI Design Lab Project:

# Design of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with inputs A, B (4-bits each) and SEL (2-bits). The inputs are loaded into registers first and the output is saved into 4-bit registers.

This repository contains the design files, simulation results, and project documentation for a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** developed using **Cadence Virtuoso** as part of the **VLSI Design Lab (EEE 4122)** at **United International University**.

## 📄 Project Overview

- **Title:** Design of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with inputs A, B (4-bits each) and SEL (2-bits).
- **Course:** EEE 4122: VLSI Design Lab
- **Semester:** SUMMER 2024
- **Submitted by:** Ayman Zafar
- **Faculty:**  Md. Zubair Alam Emon


## 🧠 Key Concepts

This project implements a **4-bit ALU** that performs basic arithmetic and logic operations using a combination of digital building blocks such as:

- Inverter, AND, OR, NAND, XOR gates  
- Multiplexers (2:1 and 4:1)  
- 1-bit and 4-bit Full Adders  
- Subtractor  
- Multiplier  
- Increment/Decrement Unit  
- Separate Arithmetic and Logic Units

All designs were created, simulated, and validated at the **transistor level** using the **Cadence Virtuoso** platform. The final output is stored in 4-bit registers after the inputs are loaded through dedicated input registers.
